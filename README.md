Once a Cosmic Event Finder; now... A Hiking Trail Finder

Unfortuntely we did have to make a change to the priginal plan as we found that there was not a suitable API available to 
supply the information required. 

We then pivoted and found an REI Hiking Trail API. Together with the OpenWeather API we are now able to pull Trail information, 
sunset and sunrise times, and even images images. 

This application allows the user to find trails based upon their State and City slections. The mentioned information above then populates into carousel on the page. The user can then search again once they have found the required information.
